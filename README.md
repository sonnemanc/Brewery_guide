# Brewery_guide

**Version 0.10**

Hello! Welcome to Corbans Brewery Guide!

Breweries are popping up all over the country and this program will help you find some new ones!
The Brewery Guide utilizes free JSON data to find and index breweries according to their city or state.
I hope you find some places you are interested in! This program was a lot of fun to make and I will add some features over time.

Cheers!
